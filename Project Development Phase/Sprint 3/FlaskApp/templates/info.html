            Parkinson's Disease
        </h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder that affects the nervous system and the parts of the body
            controlled by the nerves. Symptoms start slowly. The first symptom may be a barely noticeable tremor in just
            one hand. Tremors are common, but the disorder may also cause stiffness or slowing of movement.

            In the early stages of Parkinson's disease, your face may show little or no expression. Your arms may not
            swing when you walk. Your speech may become soft or slurred. Parkinson's disease symptoms worsen as your
            condition progresses over time.

            Although Parkinson's disease can't be cured, medications might significantly improve your symptoms.
            Occasionally, your health care provider may suggest surgery to regulate certain regions of your brain and
            improve your symptoms.

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <p>
            Parkinson's disease signs and symptoms can be different for everyone. Early signs may be mild and go
            unnoticed. Symptoms often begin on one side of the body and usually remain worse on that side, even after
            symptoms begin to affect the limbs on both sides.
            <br><br>
            Parkinson's signs and symptoms may include: <br> <br>
        </p>
        <p class="terms">
            <span>Tremor:</span> A tremor, or rhythmic shaking, usually begins in a limb, often your hand or fingers.
            You
            may rub
            your thumb and forefinger back and forth. This is known as a pill-rolling tremor. Your hand may tremble when
            it's at rest. The shaking may decrease when you are performing tasks. <br>
            <span>Slowed movement (bradykinesia):</span>Over time, Parkinson's disease may slow your movement, making
            simple tasks
            difficult and time-consuming. Your steps may become shorter when you walk. It may be difficult to get out of
            a chair. You may drag or shuffle your feet as you try to walk.
            <br>
            <span>Rigid muscles:</span> Muscle stiffness may occur in any part of your body. The stiff muscles can be
            painful and
            limit your range of motion. <br>
            <span>Impaired posture and balance:</span>Your posture may become stooped. Or you may fall or have balance
            problems as a
            result of Parkinson's disease. <br>
            <span>Loss of automatic movements:</span> You may have a decreased ability to perform unconscious movements,
            including
            blinking, smiling or swinging your arms when you walk. <br>
            <span>Speech changes:</span> You may speak softly, quickly, slur or hesitate before talking. Your speech may
            be more of a
            monotone rather than have the usual speech patterns. <br>
            <span>Writing changes:</span> It may become hard to write, and your writing may appear small. <br>

        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <p>
            In Parkinson's disease, certain nerve cells (neurons) in the brain gradually break down or die. Many of the
            symptoms are due to a loss of neurons that produce a chemical messenger in your brain called dopamine. When
            dopamine levels decrease, it causes atypical brain activity, leading to impaired movement and other symptoms
            of Parkinson's disease.
            <br><br>
            The cause of Parkinson's disease is unknown, but several factors appear to play a role, including: <br> <br>
        </p>

        <p class="terms">
            <span>Genes:</span> Researchers have identified specific genetic changes that can cause Parkinson's disease.
            But these are uncommon except in rare cases with many family members affected by Parkinson's disease.

            However, certain gene variations appear to increase the risk of Parkinson's disease but with a relatively
            small risk of Parkinson's disease for each of these genetic markers. <br>


            <span>Environmental triggers:</span>Exposure to certain toxins or environmental factors may increase the
            risk of later Parkinson's disease, but the risk is small.
            <br><br>

            Researchers have also noted that many changes occur in the brains of people with Parkinson's disease,
            although it's not clear why these changes occur. These changes include: <br> <br>

            <span>The presence of Lewy bodies:</span> Clumps of specific substances within brain cells are microscopic
            markers of Parkinson's disease. These are called Lewy bodies, and researchers believe these Lewy bodies hold
            an important clue to the cause of Parkinson's disease. <br>

            <span>Alpha-synuclein found within Lewy bodies:</span>Although many substances are found within Lewy bodies,
            scientists believe an important one is the natural and widespread protein called alpha-synuclein
            (a-synuclein). It's found in all Lewy bodies in a clumped form that cells can't break down. This is
            currently an important focus among Parkinson's disease researchers. <br>

        <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
        <p>
            Risk factors for Parkinson's disease include:
            <br> <br>
        </p>

        <p class="terms line">
            <span>Age:</span> Young adults rarely experience Parkinson's disease. It ordinarily begins in middle or late
            life, and the risk increases with age. People usually develop the disease around age 60 or older. If a young
            person does have Parkinson's disease, genetic counseling might be helpful in making family planning
            decisions. Work, social situations and medication side effects are also different from those of an older
            person with Parkinson's disease and require special considerations.<br>


            <span>Heredity:</span> Having a close relative with Parkinson's disease increases the chances that you'll
            develop the disease. However, your risks are still small unless you have many relatives in your family with
            Parkinson's disease. <br>

            <span>Sex:</span> Men are more likely to develop Parkinson's disease than women.<br>

            <span>Exposure to toxins:</span>Ongoing exposure to herbicides and pesticides may slightly increase your
            risk of Parkinson's disease.<br>
